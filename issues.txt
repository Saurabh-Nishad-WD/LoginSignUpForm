Frontend Issues for the Login and Signup Form
1. Add Password Strength Validation

Currently, the signup form doesn’t validate the strength of the password. Add validation to ensure the password meets certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, special characters, numbers).

Expected Behavior:

Display a message if the password is weak.

Prevent form submission if the password doesn’t meet the requirements.

Hint: Use JavaScript to check the password against a regex pattern.

2. Add Input Validation for Email

The signup form doesn’t validate the email input. Add validation to ensure the email is in the correct format.

Expected Behavior:

Display an error message if the email is invalid.

Prevent form submission if the email is invalid.

Hint: Use JavaScript and regex to validate the email.

3. Add a "Show Password" Toggle

Add a toggle button to show/hide the password text in both the login and signup forms.

Expected Behavior:

When clicked, the password text should be visible.

When clicked again, the password text should be hidden.

Hint: Use JavaScript to toggle the type attribute of the password input between password and text.

4. Improve Form Animations

The current animation between the login and signup forms is basic. Improve the animation to make it smoother and more visually appealing.

Expected Behavior:

Add a sliding or fading effect when toggling between forms.

Ensure the animation is smooth and doesn’t feel abrupt.

Hint: Use CSS transitions or animations.

Add a Loading Spinner on Form Submission

When the user submits the login or signup form, there’s no visual feedback. Add a loading spinner to indicate that the form is being processed.

Expected Behavior:

4. Display a loading spinner when the form is submitted.

Hide the spinner after a few seconds (simulate a backend response).

Hint: Use CSS to create a spinner and JavaScript to show/hide it.

4. Add a "Forgot Password" Link

Add a "Forgot Password" link to the login form. When clicked, display a modal or redirect to a new page for password recovery.

Expected Behavior:

Clicking the link should display a modal or redirect to a new page.

The modal/page should include a form to enter the email for password recovery.

Hint: Use JavaScript to handle the modal or redirect.

5. Add Accessibility Features

The form lacks accessibility features like keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard users.

Expected Behavior:

Add ARIA labels to form inputs and buttons.

Ensure the form can be navigated using the keyboard (e.g., Tab key).

Hint: Use aria-label and tabindex attributes.

6.Add a Dark Mode Toggle

Add a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

Expected Behavior:

Clicking the toggle should switch the theme of the form.

The selected theme should persist across page reloads.

Hint: Use JavaScript to toggle a CSS class and localStorage to save the theme preference.

7.Add a "Remember Me" Checkbox

Add a "Remember Me" checkbox to the login form. When checked, the username should be saved in localStorage and auto-filled the next time the user visits the page.

Expected Behavior:

If "Remember Me" is checked, save the username in localStorage.

Auto-fill the username on page load if it exists in localStorage.

Hint: Use localStorage to save and retrieve the username.

8.Add a Success Message After Form Submission

After submitting the login or signup form, display a success message to the user.

Expected Behavior:

Display a success message (e.g., "Login successful!" or "Signup successful!") after form submission.

The message should disappear after a few seconds.

Hint: Use JavaScript to display and hide the message.

9. Add a "Terms and Conditions" Checkbox

Add a checkbox to the signup form that requires users to agree to the terms and conditions before submitting the form.

Expected Behavior:

Prevent form submission if the checkbox is not checked.

Display an error message if the checkbox is not checked.

Hint: Use JavaScript to validate the checkbox.

10. Add a "Reset Form" Button

Add a "Reset Form" button to clear all input fields in the login and signup forms.

Expected Behavior:

Clicking the button should clear all input fields.

The form should return to its initial state.

Hint: Use JavaScript to reset the form.

11. Add a "Close" Button for the Signup Form

Add a "Close" button to the signup form to allow users to return to the login form without submitting.

Expected Behavior:

Clicking the button should toggle back to the login form.

Hint: Use JavaScript to toggle the form visibility.

12. Add a "Password Match" Indicator

Add a visual indicator to show whether the password and confirm password fields match in the signup form.

Expected Behavior:

Display a green checkmark if the passwords match.

Display a red cross if the passwords don’t match.

Hint: Use JavaScript to compare the password fields and update the UI.

13. Add a "Max Length" Validation for Input Fields

Add validation to ensure the username and password fields don’t exceed a certain length.

Expected Behavior:

Display an error message if the input exceeds the maximum length.

Prevent form submission if the input exceeds the maximum length.

Hint: Use JavaScript to check the length of the input fields.
